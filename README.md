# Implementation-of-UDP-Lite-in-ns-3
1. Do all the changes related to our implementation in the udplite branch.
2. We will keep master in sync with original dev repository and rebase udplite branch code onto master branch code whenever needed.

Progress:  
Read the UDP-lite rfc-3828.  
Read the basic ns3 tutorials on nsnam website.  
Shared the headers and methods of udp implementaion in ns3 with mohit sir in a google doc.     
Read and understood the udp-lite implementation in linux kernel. 

Right now working on:  
Trying to understand the ns3 udp implementation and based on that writting a pseudocode of udp-lite
