# Implementation-of-UDP-Lite-in-ns-3
1. Do all the changes related to our implementation in the udplite branch.
2. We will keep master in sync with original dev repository and rebase udplite branch code onto master branch code whenever needed.

Progress:  
Read the UDP-lite rfc-3828  
Read the basic ns3 tutorials on nsnam website  
Read and understood the udp-lite implementation in linux kernel 

Right now working on:  
Trying to understand the ns3 udp implementation and based on that writting a pseudocode of udp-lite
